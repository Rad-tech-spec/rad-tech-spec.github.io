    date: Sep. 2022 - Dec. 2022

      We were asked to develop a new cloud-based microservice for a fictional Canadian company. This company specializes 
      in producing automotive parts and has been working hard for the past three years to connect, digitize, and automate all of its internal systems.

      As the new system has been built, the company has identified a missing capability such as many sub-systems need to be able to work with small fragments of text or images. 
      These are smaller than a traditional 'document' and use a large number of different formats.

    desc:  
      - "IoT devices on the manufacturing floor produce a variety of reports (text) that need to get stored and retrieved. Some use plain text, others CSV files, and others JSON."
      - "Factory workers use a variety of existing mobile apps to write short status updates and reports, which need to be saved as JSON, Markdown, plain Text, and sometimes HTML."
      - "Automated cameras on assembly lines take regular images of damaged parts, which need to get stored for audit purposes."

      The company invest in a highly scalable service for working with these so-called fragments of text and images. This service needs to connect seamlessly with the rest of the existing 
      systems (e.g., use existing authorization, and work over HTTP). It also needs to be deployed to AWS, which is the cloud provider used for the rest of the company's systems."

      Health is a necessity that should be made available to all living things. Today the usage of modern technology and tools is continuously increasing, 
      and the prevention of health issues is seen in most of these technologies we use. Health surveys are commonly conducted in daily human lives and have proven to be reliable. 
      Technology has provided people with the knowledge and power to predict, solve and prevent some of these chronic health issues and saving several lives. 
      With the same idea of improving the health conditions and improve time management, we as young software developers saw a window of opportunity to make use of our expertise in this field.
